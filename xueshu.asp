<h2 align="center" class="STYLE1">Smart Antennas for Mobile Communication</h2>
<p align="left"><br />
  As the growing demand for mobile communications is constantly increasing，the need for better
  improved capacity，  and higher transmission quality rises．Thus，a more efficlent use of the radio spectrum is required．Smart antenna systems are capable of efficiently utilizing the radio spectrum
  and are a promise for an effective solution to the present wireless systems’problems while achieving reliable and robust high-speed high．data-rate transmission．The term Smart Antennas(SA) means antennas 
  that are able to form RF beams in order to focus on the selected communication channel and to blind out
  interference.  In fact,smart antenna systems comprise several critical areas such as individual antenna
  array design,signal processing algorithms，space―time processing，wireless channel modeling and coding
  and network performance.<br />
  SA is an emerging technology that has gained much attention over the last few years for its ability<br />
  to significantly increase the performance of wireless systems．SA is being inserted into 2.5 generation<br />
(GSM-EDGE)and third generation(IMT 2000) mobile cellular networks.</p>

  1．Smart antenna advantages</h3>
<p align="left"><br />
  Smart antenna systems capture，  convert，  and modulate analog signals for transmission as digital
  signals and reconvert them to analog information on the other end．  Smart Antenna technology exploits
  multiple antennas in transmit and receive with associated coding，  modulation and signal processmg to
  enhance the perfomance of wireless systems in terms of capacity，coverage and throughput.  SA techniques can therefore be used for downlink and uplink both at the BTS(base transceiver stations)  and CPE(customer premises equipment)．  SA leverages(on transmit and receive) include：<br />
</p>
<p align="left">Arrav Gain：  Multiple antennas coherently combine the signal energy improving the carrier-to-noise ratio(C／N): Available both on transmit and receive．    <br />
  Diversity Gain：  Spatial diversity obtained from multiple antennas helps combat channel fading.
Available on transmit and receive．</p>
<p align="left">Interference Suppression Gain：Multiple antennas can be adaptively combined to selectively cancel or avoid interference and pass the desired signal．Available on transmit and receive．<br />
  Spatial Multiplexing：Spatial multiplexing uses multiple antennas．at both ends to create multiple channels and improves spectrum efficiency(bps／Hz)．</p>
<h3> 2．Types ot smart antennas</h3>
<p><br />
  Smart antennas consist of an antenna array，combined with signal processing in both space and<br />
  time. Spatial processing leads to more degrees of freedom in the system design，which can help to<br />
  improve the overall performance of the system．Smart antennas，when used appropriated，help in<br />
  lmprovmg the system performance by increasing channel capacity and spectrum efficiency，extending<br />
  range coverage by steering multiple beams to track many mobiles．Smart antenna systems are usually<br />
  categorized as switched beamer，and adaptive array systems．</p>
<p> switched beam―a finite number of fixed，predefined patterns or combining strategies(sectors)．<br />
  adaptive array―an infinite number of patterns(scenario―based)that are adjusted in real time．</p>
<h3 align="left">3.Signal modeling</h3>
<p align="left">Modeling signal is an important step in the design of array signal processing. Consider a linear antenna array of L isotropic elements. If antennas are identical in the array and all antenna have the same response in any given direction. </p>

<h3 align="left">4．WCDMA and SDMA</h3>
<p align="left"><br />
  WCDMA(Wideband Code Division Multiple Access)is the radio access scheme used for third<br />
  generation cellular systems that are being rolled out in various parts of the globe．The 3G systems to<br />
  support wideband services like high．speed Internet access，  video and high quality image transtmsslon<br />
  with the salne quality as the fixed networks．In WCDMA systems the CDMA air interface is combined<br />
  with GSM based networks．The WCDMA standard was evolved through the Third Generation Partner-<br />
  ship Project(3GPP)which aims to ensure interoperability between different 3G networks.<br />
  The standard that has emerged through this partnership project is based on ETSI’S Universal Mobile<br />
  Telecommunication System(UMTS)and is commonly known as UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access<br />
  (UTRA)．The access scheme for UTRA is Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access(DS-CD-MA)．The information i s spread over a band of approximately 5 MHz．This wide bandwidth has given<br />
  rise to the nanle Wideband CDMA or WCDMA．<br />
In WCDMA．there are two different modes of operation possible：<br />
<br />
TDD：In this duplex method，uplink and downlink transmissions are carried over the same frequency band by using synchronized time intervals．Thus time slots in a physical channel are divided into
transmission and reception part． <br />
FDD：The uplink and downlink transmissions employ two separated frequency bands for this duplex
method．  A pair Of frequency bands with specified separation is assigned for a connection．  Since differ-<br />
ent regions have different frequency allocation schemes，the capability to operate in either FDD or TDD<br />
mode allows for efficient utilization of the available spectrum．</p>
<p align="left">The key operational features of the WCDMA radio interface are listed below：<br />
  Support Of high data rate transmission：3 84 Kbps with wide area coverage，2 Mbps with local coverage.<br />
  High service flexibility：support of multiple parallel variable rate services on each connection．<br />
  Both Frequency Division Duplex(FDD)and Time Division Duplex(TDD)．<br />
  Built in support for future capacity and coverage enhancing technologies like adaptive antennas，<br />
  advanced receiver structures and transmitter diversity．<br />
  Support Of inter frequency hand over and hand over to other systems，  including hand over to
  GSM．<br />
  Among the most sophisticated utilizations of smart antenna technology is SDMA(spatial division<br />
  multiple access)，which employs advanced processing techniques to，in effect，locate and track fixed<br />
  or mobile terminals．  adaptively steering transmission signals toward users and away from interferers.<br />
  This adaptive array technology achieves superior levels of interference suppression，making possible<br />
  more efficient reuse of frequencies than the standard fixed hexagonal reuse patterns.  In essence，the<br />
  scheme Can adapt the frequency allocations to where the most users are located.<br />
  Utilizing highly sophisticated algorithms and rapid processing hardware，spatial processmg takes<br />
  the reuse advantages that result from interference suppression to a new level．  In essence，  spatial processing dynamically creates a different sector for each user and conducts a frequency／channel allocation
  in an ongoing manner in real time．</p>
